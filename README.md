Ecommerce Website using Andriod

Starting from a home screen with a logo, when a user presses a button, they should be taken to a list
of products displayed in card form. The list should be created from some collection of data like an
ArrayList. You’ll need to combine the list with a RecyclerView to create a CardView for each piece of
data. When the user clicks on a card, they’re taken to another screen which contains the full
information about the product they clicked as well as a button to purchase it. Finally they’re taken to a
final screen with a check-out form.
